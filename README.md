# Description

QuattroSync is an add-on designed to improve synchronization between the MMU extruder and the toolhead, ensuring more precise and reliable material changes.

Its design simplifies assembly by using standardized components, such as common ECAS and single-size springs. The switches require no screws for mounting, just snap them into place, making installation even easier.
Additionally, its appearance has been carefully crafted to aesthetically match the QuattroBox, forming a cohesive and functional unit.
